# ERP Correlates of Change Detection: Comparison of Different References

This repository contains the experiment script for a study titled "Electrophysiological correlates of change detection during delayed matching task: a comparison of different references", published in Frontiers in Neuroscience in 2017. Liang and colleagues (2017) highlights the importance of carefully selecting the reference electrode when interpreting EEG studies on change detection. The findings suggest that the REST reference may provide more accurate cognitive interpretations for ERP correlates of change detection during a delayed matching task. Please note that the authors of this paper are not involved in this repository, and the data collected for this study is not available due to privacy regulations.

## Overview
Detecting changes in information between memory representation and incoming sensory inputs is a fundamental cognitive ability. We aimed to replicate the electrophysiological correlates of change detection during a delayed matching task based on the linked mastoid (LM) reference method using our device. Colored shapes were used as materials, with both the task-relevant and -irrelevant color feature and shape feature being changed.

## Experiment Script
The experiment script used in this study can be found with the name of "experimentScript.m". It includes the code for presenting the visual stimuli, recording unixtimes for matching the EEG clock, and saving the data in a compatible format for analysis. Please note that this script was written using the Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3) for MATLAB, and may require some modifications depending on the specific requirements of your hardware and software setup.

## Stimuli Pictures
We have also added an "ExpStims" folder that includes all the images used during the experiment for presentation purposes.

## Analysis Script
The analysis script for this study will be included in this repository.


## Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to replicate the electrophysiological correlates of change detection during a delayed matching task using the linked mastoid reference method with our device. The findings of this replication study should be interpreted with caution, and further research is required to validate the results.
